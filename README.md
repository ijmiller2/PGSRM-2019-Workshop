# PGSRM-2019-Workshop
This a repository with instructions and source code for the [PGSRM 2019](https://sites.google.com/wisc.edu/pgsrm-2019/home) Workshop.

## Workshop Topic: A brief introduction to applications and analysis of mass spectrometry data in the pharmaceutical industry

### Practicum: Leveraging open source software tools for reproducible research. 

In this workshop we will start with a brief introduction to mass spectrometry and relevant datatypes as they apply to biomedical research and pharmaceutical sciences. We will then spend the rest of our time learning some basics of Python programming to recreate some of the analysis performed in a [recent paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/31098) from the lab of [Jim Wells](https://pharm.ucsf.edu/wells). The paper is titled “Targeting RAS-Driven Human cancer cells with antibodies to upregulated and essential cell-surface proteins” and was selected for its relevance to pharmaceutical development, interrogation of biological systems with both small and large biomolecules, mass spectrometry-based proteomics, and supplementary data to enable reproducibility of the authors’ analysis. 

To prepare for this workshop, we encourage you to briefly read over the paper (at least through the first results section) and install the most recent version of [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Although it will be useful for you to have an installation of Anaconda Python for your future efforts in data analysis, the installation will not be strictly necessary as we will be able to run and edit our code for free on Microsoft’s Azure [platform for Jupyter Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com). If you do not wish to install Anaconda Python on your own laptop, you will need to start a (free) account with Microsoft Azure. Previous programming experience is not required.
